The parameter for dd that does this is count=. Your last partition ends on 103, and your unit size is 8225280 bytes 
(according to the "fdisk -l" output or "lsblk -o NAME,PHY-SeC" or "hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep -i physical" ). 
So you could simply modify your command this way:


dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=7847936
