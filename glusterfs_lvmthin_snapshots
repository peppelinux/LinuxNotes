we need to mount these LVs to form the bricks. Use the mount command to do so.

mount /dev/mygroup/thinv1 /bricks/brick1


Using the lvm2_setup instructions, in this git repository, you can create one or more bricks. 
For our testing I created one more brick in “anotherhost” machine. 
Lets create a Gluster volume from these LVs. Use the following command to do so.

gluster volume create vol1 replica 2 myhost:/bricks/brick1/b1 anotherhost:/bricks/brick1/b1


We have a volume with bricks created out of thin LVs. We are now ready to  test and use the snapshot feature. Ah, forgot one thing. You need to first start the volume.

gluster volume start vol1
