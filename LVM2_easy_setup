To create a LVM, we need to run through the following steps.

    Select the physical storage devices for LVM
    Create the Volume Group from Physical Volumes
    Create Logical Volumes from Volume Group

In this step, we need to choose the physical volumes that will be used to create the LVM. 
We can create the physical volumes using pvcreate command as shown below.

$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sda6 /dev/sda7 
Physical volume "/dev/sda6" successfully created                                                 
Physical volume "/dev/sda7" successfully created 

# check them
sudo pvscan                                                                   
  PV /dev/sda6                      lvm2 [1.86 GB]                                                 
  PV /dev/sda7                      lvm2 [1.86 GB]                                                 
  Total: 2 [3.72 GB] / in use: 0 [0   ] / in no VG: 2 [3.72 GB]   

You can view the list of physical volumes with attributes like size, physical 
extent size, total physical extent size, the free space, etc., 
using pvdisplay command as shown below.

$ sudo pvdisplay 

Volume groups are nothing but a pool of storage that consists of one or more physical volumes. 
Once you create the physical volume, you can create the volume group (VG) from these physical volumes (PV).

In this example, the volume group vol_grp1 is created from the two physical volumes as shown below.

$ sudo vgcreate vol_grp1 /dev/sda6 /dev/sda7                                  
  Volume  group "vol_grp1" successfully created          

vgdisplay command lists the created volume groups.
$ sudo vgdisplay 

Now, everything is ready to create the logical volumes from the volume groups. 
lvcreate command creates the logical volume with the size of 2GB.

$ sudo lvcreate -l 2G -n logical_vol1 vol_grp1 
  Logical volume "logical_vol1" created      

Use lvdisplay command as shown below, to view the available logical volumes with its attributes.
$ sudo lvdisplay    

After creating the appropriate filesystem on the logical volumes, it becomes ready to use for the storage purpose.
$ sudo  mkfs.ext4 /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1 

We can extend the size of the logical volumes after creating it by using lvextend utility as shown below. 
The changes the size of the logical volume from 2GB to 4GB.

$ sudo lvextend -L4G /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1 
  Extending logical volume logical_vol1 to 4 GB 
  Logical volume logical_vol1 successfully resized 

We can also ADD additional size to a specific logical volume as shown below.

$ sudo lvextend -L+2G /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1 
  Extending logical volume logical_vol1 to 6 GB
  Logical volume logical_vol1 successfully resized
